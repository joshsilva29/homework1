What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge integrates the changes from one branch to another branch. A rebase does this also, but does not
preserve the history from the source branch AND moves all the work (including the history) from the source
branch to the target branch. 

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a Git repository that lives on a server and is accessible by all
team members. This is different from a local repository, which is stored on the members'
local computers.
